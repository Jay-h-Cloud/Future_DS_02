📊 Customer Support Data Analysis & Ticket Resolution

## 📝 About the Project

This project was part of a data analysis task where I worked on real-world customer support ticket data. The main objective was to analyze and categorize customer queries to find frequently reported issues and provide solutions to reduce resolution time.

I used a combination of Excel for quick insights and Python (with Pandas and NLTK) for more advanced analysis and automation. The final deliverable was a structured report highlighting key findings and recommendations.

- Applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize ticket descriptions.
- Identified high-frequency issues like login failures, payment problems, and password reset requests.
- Suggested automation strategies such as chatbot responses and improved ticket routing.

## 📊 Summary of Analysis

- Text data was tokenized and cleaned (lowercased, stopwords removed, punctuations stripped).
- Issue categories were created based on keyword frequency and similarity.
- A bar chart and summary table were created to visualize top issues.
- Identified delays in ticket resolution caused by repetitive queries and lack of categorization.
